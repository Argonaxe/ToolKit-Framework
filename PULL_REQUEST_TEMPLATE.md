Known Issues:
1. IE8 is a no go. 
2. Lacking functionality.

Possible Issues:
1. There may be many bugs that I've not yet encountered. 
2. My choice of documentation may not match the documentation that you're currently using.
3. May be a bit buggy on different devices, although from my own testing, it's worked well so far.

Pros: 
1. It runs purely on vanilla javascript, so no need for jQuery or Angular.

3. It works well, so far.
