# ToolkitV2

Whilst I was roughly half way through the first version, I quickly began to realise that I had made the software rather bloated and therefore defeated my main foal with this library. So I decided to wipe the slate clean and simply start again, plus considering that I've been working on a few side project which are a lot smaller, I thought I could include those too.

## Why ToolKitJS?
ToolKitJS isn't like a lot of other JavaScript libraries where they may be considered a framework simply because of just how much they do. ToolKitJS is _essentially_ a bundle of libraries, each of which being small, fast and simple to use. 

The ideal time to use ToolKitJS is for JavaScript applications that require reasonably sophisticated tools, but with performance being one of the largest factors possible. 

### The Inspiration Behind ToolKitJS
As I'm a web developer, I work with JavaScript all of the time, and I find it **insane** just how many JavaScript tools/frameworks/libraries are slowly becoming more and more bloated as time goes on. In my books, as performance, efficiency and optimisation are all large focuses this isn't acceptable. 

Initially with version 1, I basically contradicted myself, I actually got in the mindset which I think most of these JavaScript developers get into where they create more than what's necessary. I had the urge to add as much functionality as possible, hence the contradiction, and ultimately destroying the _'lightweight'_ factor that I was going for.  

### What Happened To Version 1?
I simply binned it, I sure it's on git if you look through the commits, but mostly I consider that old and messy code. I guess you can consider the first version a _'trial & error'_ phase. 

**Be warned** a lot of the raw functionality that you could find in version 1 has been removed, purely because while some of the features are neat or useful and simple. I believe that the user of ToolKitJS should be more than capable of implementing those features when needed rather than have ToolKitJS include it. An example being lazy loading for images, I'm pretty **certain** that a developer **should** be more than capable of developing their own lazy loading application/algorithm. 

### So what now? 
From this moment on, I plan to continue development on ToolKitJS, I also plan to begin uploading content and features later today(_21/02018_).


## So What's Included?
Here's a list of features to expect: 

- AJAX
- Promises
- Multi Threading
- Template Engine 
- Asynchronous Features
- Utilities 
  - Event Handler
  - DOM Selector 
  - etc.

As you can see above, there's not a great deal of features included, _unlike version 1_, but the features that are included are pretty darn useful and powerful tools. You should take note that I've personally decided to drop support for IE9, if your target audience uses stone age technology, then I suggest you look through the half finished version 1 code and take what you like. I'm only dropping support for IE9 simply because it cannot handle features such as multi threading, there may be work around's, but as I aim to keep this library lightweight, I will not include such features.
