## What is ToolKit-JS?
Simple, ToolKit-JS is simply as the name would suggest, a toolkit for the front end web language JavaScript. I, Joseph Evans am writing this to allow developers to use and learn how to write lightweight vanilla JavaScript, as I know many front end web developers that don't just **use** jQuery, but they **rely** on it. I've even heard a couple of horror stories where a front end developer may not know what the difference is between the two. I'm not saying I will replace jQuery, that's not my goal, nor is it the purpose of ToolKit-JS, the **main** purpose of ToolKit-JS is to add a bunch of neat features to your web application. Whether it's expanding on the barebones of JS, by adding functions to what's already there, or creating and implementing data structures, all done in vanilla JavaScript. 

As a web developer, I will try to utilise technologies and techniques that works across a variation of devices and browsers, including **IE9**, despite the fact that **Microsoft no longer supports IE9**.

### So whatâ€™s included?
The plan is to include generic data structures, a bunch of neat global functions, animation, XHR functionality, etc, you name it. Again, as it says above, I plan on implementing all of the functionality to the point where it runs solidly on IE9+. I should also mention that I plan to include a couple of additional features which are partially open to change, such as a wish list implementation and a recently view implementation.
