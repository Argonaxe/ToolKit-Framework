        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>ToolKit is a nice client side JavaScript library that offers something
        a little different that you'd expect to see in most JavaScript libraries.
        ToolKit doesn't offer a great deal in the way that a tool such as jQuery,
        but rather more advance tools, an example being the multithreading wrapper
        that's included. ToolKit comes with a few very neat, fast and reasonably
        powerful and stable features, if you like you can customise which features
        you wish to include by having a look at the following components
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JO3-W3B-D3V/ToolKit-JS/tree/master/src/development">here</a>.
        </p>

      <div id="whyuse" class="doc">
        <h3>Why use ToolKit?</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>This is a simple question, and it deserves a simple answer, ToolKit is
        simply made by developer(s) whom are passionate about getting the best
        performance:bloat:power:featureful ratio possible.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="DOM" class="doc">
        <h3>Targeting DOM Elements</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>Out of the box, the ultimate aim of ToolKit is to provide a front end developer
        with some tools that a front end developer may need, without the cost of overloading
        the front end with bloated code nor does it include a great deal of complexity. This
        is a part of the reason as to why ToolKit doesn't come with an endless supply of tools,
        such as some of the many DOM manipulation tools that you'd find in something
        like jQuery, as an example.</p>
        <p>If you wish to stay away from jQuery, then ToolKit does include a simple
        feature that allows you to target DOM elements, however the style is ever so
        slightly different to prevent any issues with those whom wish to use jQuery.
        If you wish to target DOM elements in a similar fashion to jQuery's DOM targeting
        tool, you can do it like so:</p>
        <div>
          jQuery's implementation: <pre>$</pre>
        </div>
        <div>
           ToolKit's implementation: <pre>ToolKit.$e</pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="AJAX" class="doc">
        <h3>AJAX</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>Furthermore, if you wish to use AJAX, you can do so with ToolKit also.
        One neat feature about ToolKit's implementation of AJAX is that it will
        automatically set the 'no-sniff' header, just to <i>help</i> ensure that your
        front end application is secure. <b>However</b>, there are a few subtle
        differences when comparing the jQuery implementation of AJAX to the ToolKit
        implementation. For one they take parameters that are <i>slightly</i> different,
        however if you're familiar with jQuery's AJAX, this shouldn't be anything new.</p>
        <div>
          jQuery's implementation: <pre>$.ajax</pre>
        </div>
        <div>
          ToolKit's implementation: <pre>ToolKit.AJAX</pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
